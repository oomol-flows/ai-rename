# AI Rename (English)

ü§ñ Intelligent file renaming using multimodal AI models

## Overview

AI Rename is an intelligent OOMOL workflow that automatically renames files based on their content using advanced multimodal AI models. It's perfect for organizing image collections, documents, and other files with meaningful names.

## Features

‚ú® **Intelligent Renaming**: Analyzes file content to generate meaningful names
üñºÔ∏è **Multi-format Support**: Works with images and various file types
üîÑ **Batch Processing**: Rename multiple files at once
ü§ñ **AI-Powered**: Uses state-of-the-art multimodal models (oomol-VL)
üìÅ **Folder Organization**: Maintains folder structure while renaming
üéØ **User-Friendly**: Simple drag-and-drop interface

## How It Works

1. **Select Source Folder**: Choose the folder containing files to rename
2. **AI Analysis**: The multimodal model analyzes each file's content
3. **Generate Names**: AI creates descriptive, meaningful filenames
4. **Batch Rename**: All files are renamed automatically with intelligent names

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- OOMOL platform installed
- Internet connection for AI model access

### Installation
1. Import this workflow into your OOMOL platform
2. The workflow will automatically install required dependencies

### Running the Workflow
1. Open the AI Rename flow in OOMOL
2. Click on the "Copy folder" node and select your source folder
3. The AI will analyze and rename all files in the folder
